# Q-Rand-Num

Hello World!
This is a Quantum Bitstring Generator

# Getting Started
- **Before running the below always ensure your in the correct directory.**
1) To get started make sure you have python 3.6 or later and pip installed, run the following in your terminal if you are on MacOS or any Linux Based OS:
**If you have get any errors in running this then run `2.`**
```
./requierments.sh
```
2) Run this only if you get any errors in `1.` :
```
./fixed.sh
```

3) If you are on Windows run the following in your Command Prompt:
```
.\setup.bat
```
4) Then on Windows run:
```
.\requierments.bat
```

4) Now to run the app run the following on MacOS or Linux:\
**If you get any erros run `5.`**
```
./runner.sh
```
5) Run this only if you get any errors in `4.` :
```
./fixed2.sh
```
6) If you are on Windows run:
```
.\runner.bat
```

# Note:
- While running the Desktop app you need to press enter once you've entered a number in the text box.
- As this is using Qiskit and IBM Quantum, the actual quantum computer as of now will be noisy and there could be a long queue on public devices. So it is using QASM Simulator as of now.
