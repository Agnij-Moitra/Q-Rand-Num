# Q-Rand-Num

Hello World!
This is a Quantum Bitstring Generator

To get started make sure you have python 3.6 or later and pip installed, and that you are in the correct directorty run the following in your terminal if you are on MacOS or any Linux Based OS:
```
./requierments.sh
```

If you are on Windows run the following in your Command Prompt:
```
.\requierments.bat
```

Now to run the app run:
```
python main.py
```

# Note:
- While running the Desktop app you need to press enter once you've entered a number in the text box.
- As this is using Qiskit and IBM Quantum, the actual quantum computer as of now will be noisy and there could be a long queue on public devices. So it is using QASM Simulator as of now.
