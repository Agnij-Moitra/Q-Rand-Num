# Q-Rand-Num

Hello World!
This is a Quantum Bitstring Generator

# Getting Started
- **Before running the below always ensure your in the correct directory.**
## For MacOS and Linux:
1) To get tarted make sure you have python 3.6 or later and pip installed, run the following in your terminal if you are on MacOS or any Linux Based OS:
**If you have get any errors in running this then run `2.`**
```
./setup.sh
```
2) Run:
```
./fixed.sh
```
3) Run:
```
./requirements.sh
```
4) On finally to run the app:
```
python main.py
```
**If this doesn't work then run**:
```
python3 main.py
```
# Note:
- While running the Desktop app you need to press enter once you've entered a number in the text box.
- As this is using Qiskit and IBM Quantum, the actual quantum computer as of now will be noisy and there could be a long queue on public devices. So it is using QASM Simulator as of now.
